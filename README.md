# HuntX-project
# Project Overview
HuntX is a gamified data engineering project built to showcase proficiency in Python, SQL, Snowflake, AWS (S3 & QuickSight), and data pipeline management. The project simulates a story-driven data model that analyzes the hunting of rare animals, capturing data for various species, rarity, and locations, then processing it for use in business insights.

# Technologies Used:

Python (Data Cleaning, Processing, ETL Pipelines)

SQL (Data Analysis, Querying)

Snowflake (Cloud Data Warehousing)

AWS S3 (Data Storage)

AWS QuickSight (Data Visualization)

Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)

Faker (Data Generation)

# Project Goals
Design an end-to-end data pipeline using Python and AWS tools.

Build a cloud-based solution for storing, processing, and analyzing large-scale data.

Apply data engineering and data analytics skills to deliver actionable insights from simulated gaming data.

Use real-world technologies to handle synthetic game event data, ensuring that it aligns with industry standards.

# Key Features
Data Ingestion: Collects game event data from multiple sources and processes it through automated pipelines.

Data Transformation: Cleans and structures data for analysis, creating key insights into player behaviors and game mechanics.

Cloud Integration: Stores the data in AWS S3 and uses Snowflake for data warehousing.

Data Visualization: Displays insightful metrics using AWS QuickSight dashboards.

# Future Enhancements
Integrate Real-Time Data from external sources (e.g., APIs, databases).

Add Machine Learning capabilities to predict animal behavior based on historical data.

Expand the cloud infrastructure to include AWS Lambda for serverless computing and more automation.
